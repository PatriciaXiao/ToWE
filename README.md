Task-oriented Word Embedding

This software implements the task-oriented word embedding for text classification.

## Installation

type ```make```

on mac we probably need to [install and activate the gcc](https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/254380/why-am-i-getting-an-invalid-active-developer-path-when-attempting-to-use-git-a)

## Example

The example file of domain specific words is provided in "domainwords.txt". 

## To run:

```shell
./towe -train 5groupcorpus -output output.txt -cbow 1 -size 300  -negative 25 -hs 1 -sample 1e-4 -threads 30 -binary 0 -iter 20 -alpha2 0.1 -beta 0.1 -group_count 50 -list domainwords.txt
```

Here,

-train is the training corpus

-group_count is the size of random sample for constructing the word-pairs of salient word (detailed in equation 3 in the paper).

-alpha2 is the learning rate of the function-aware component

-beta is the combination parameter (denoted as lambda in the paper)

-list is the file of domain specific words, where each line contains salient words for one category.

The learnt word embedding will be written to output.txt, specified by -output.
